# FOODBUDDY
# Motivation
Food delivery services such as Zomato and Swiggy are popular nowadays and many restaurants use their services. However it is not beneficial to them as they do not allow the restaurants to build a relationship with their customers. This serves as a problem for them as they are not able to grow as an individual entity. Thus to solve this problem we have have created a platform called FoodBuddy which will allow users to reserve spaces at a restaurant and host food related gatherings. Thus this will allow the users to actually bond with the restaurants and help them to grow. The users will also grow individually as they can sell their food (which is properly packed) right at the restaurant on the day of the event.
